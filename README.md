# SlothyPoo Gallery Website
Art Gallery for my sister. She goes by SlothyPoo online

A web application for managing artwork and displaying it publicly. At the time of launch, it should be able to perform the following actions on the general user end:

- Display Artist Info and how to contact them
- Display Artist uploaded images with filtering options
- Present options for Commissions along with examples and pricing
- Inform clients of commission limitations as set by the Artist

It should also perform these actions for the site Admin (Myself and SlothyPoo):

- Upload Images with a variety of options to assist in the filtering options of the Gallery
- Display uploads with additional information, some of which may normally be hidden
- Allow for the Editing and Deleting of uploads

# Current Production
As of 10/21/2022 the website is capable of the following actions:

- Artist can Upload and Delete, but not edit
- Main Page, Gallery, Site Manager, and superuser login are MVP'd
- Gallery can display artwork of varying sizes, filter by tags, and allows images to be clicked on for a larger view

Frontend CSS and many general UI elements are in a very basic state

# To Be Completed
The following is yet to be completed:

- Final CSS and overall appearance (waiting on resources to be made available)
- Once a Filter is selected, there is no way to return to displaying All Artwork without a page refresh
- A easy way to toggle on and off Commission Availability from Site Manager
- Commission Page is navigatable but does nothing
- TOS Page is navigatable but does nothing
- Site Manager is incapable of editing, only Uploading and Deleting
